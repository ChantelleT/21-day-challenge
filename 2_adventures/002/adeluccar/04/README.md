Rubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-05 002)

Day 04 Goal
Create a small program that is able to take a text file and return an array containing each line as an array element.

Thoughts: I believe that since the program is to be used in conjuction with the shell, then returning the final array would not work. I need some way of delivering the "strings" to the shell and I used print for that. As of now, the program is operational. The main goal was to learn how to read a text file in ruby and manipulate it somewhat. Some additional avenues to explore are the use of arguments, so that we can remove the hardcoded file and use any text file. Also, a way of stripping the endline characters from the array.
