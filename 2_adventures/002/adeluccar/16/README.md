IRubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-05 002)

Day 16
Today was an awesome day! I didn't work with Ruby but I worked with programming nonetheless. You see, I'm currently working on a project of an art collection that needs to be sold and the owners are using collectrium software to manage the collection.
Except, the collection is not uploaded yet in the web app (and it doesn't have a batch uploader). You can imagine now how painful it is to upload a whole bunch of images without a batch uploader. So I went ahead and built a macro in Keyboard Maestro that helps me upload the images. I just need to add them to a local directory and then activate the macro, and it will create objects (create the actual painting record) and then upload the image and so forth.
Very nice stuff. I might upload the images of the macro so that you guys can see how it works. It's not Ruby, but it's a look at programming that might help beginners.
