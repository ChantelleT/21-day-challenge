Rubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-05 002)

Day 19
In an interesting change of pace, I was forced to split an .mkv file in order add it to a FAT formatted pen-drive. FAT drives only allow files of 4.3GB maximum.
I used mkvmerge (which is a part of the mkvtoolnix package) in order to do so from the command line.
Unfortunately, this brought another connundrum. How to split the subtitles too? You see, Mac OS X has a true shortage in tools for dealing with subtitles and the only tool in the app store was out of date. I managed to find Aegisub and was saved. I did have to fiddle a bit with a decididly ugly UI but managed to get the job done.
