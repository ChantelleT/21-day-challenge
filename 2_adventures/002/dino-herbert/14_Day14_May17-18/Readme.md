Day 14: This file will check whether the results of an equation are odd or even given 3 unknown variables.
Is the result of the following equation an odd integer? (m^2 + n)(2m + p). m, n and p are positive integers.  
Variable 'p' is even; the other two can be either odd or even.
....needs refactoring to make sure input is only positive integers.

Is using "=begin" and "=end" considered 'old school ruby'?  It makes more sense to me when commenting out many lines of code at the beginning of a program.
