      fun in computing. When it started out it was an awful lot of fun. We began to feel as if we really were
      responsible for the successful error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't
      think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in
      new directions and keeping fun in the house."</h2>
