## Forth day of Iteration 2 ðŸ˜¼

Reading Docs is essentials. While I'm offline,  I use Dash from Kapeli. I love how it's one place for many offline Docs and easy to search with a quick result render.
You can use Dash for free, but every time you need to search, it will shows a 'clock' counting down from 8 to 0 before it shows the result.  
For sure buying it is worth the money, but of you don't want or don't like to switch between different applications and want stay in the same environment, then you have the `ri` option. 

Using `ri` Doc is free, easy, fast and you have it.   
You might have downloading `ri-doc` is disabled by default within `~/.gemrc` file, like so:
`gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc`. If this is the case, change it to `gem: -ri --no-rdoc`. The `rdoc` option is for HTML doc, you can enable it if you want to.

Also you can generate `ri-doc` for all existing gems by doing so: `gem rdoc --all --ri --no-rdoc`.

Happy Docing ðŸ˜‰
