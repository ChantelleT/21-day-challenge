## Writing Process

As everyone else, I have lots of ideas and thoughts that could be an app or subjects that could be an articles. The sad thing is they store on my messy cloud "Brain". 
I need to have a system that makes it easy for me to remember and organize my thoughts. 

### Tools
Here is what i have found and started to follow.

[Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) as an editor.  
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) as cloud base repository for Scrivener documents.   
[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) as a thoughts and ideas collector (desktop and phone).

I have done the setup and organization and started to use and I like it so far. I just need to have a fixed time/schedule to write more, hopefully twice a week.
