### Turning up the Good!

- Got into a great flow of TDD on Day 2. It was a tiny feature within my [CodeTime](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/code-time/blob/master/code_time_spec.rb) project (correctly displaying time spent coding to the user based on session length), but it was great fun to actually build out a feature without hitting any bottlenecks.

- Looking forward to doing some Deliberate Discovery today with [CodeTime](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/code-time) today and finding those pesky bottlenecks and working on the weaknesses that allow them to be bottlenecks.

Looking forward to Day 3. Nothing beats actually coding instead of being stuck!
