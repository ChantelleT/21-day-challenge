### Learning About Rails By Mistake

- By persisting code time sessions in a database in my little project [CodeTime](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/code-time) I've had to think about how to create a clean API for saving objects to a database. I've still got a lot of cleanup to do in my fledgling ORM, but I can definitely see how when working with databases a developer would naturally tend towards constructing some sort of ORM. This has been a really interesing part of the project.

- Continuing with building an unrelated Rails project in Day 6 and also doing some refactoring in CodeTime.

Building things on my own and learning from my bottlenecks/weaknesses has improved my skills and confidence massively. It's such a simple idea, buts it's difficult to do efficiently as a beginner. I'm slowly collecting a series of tips and tricks (with help from the RubySteps Playbook) to help me build things on my own with as few bottlenecks and sources of frustration as possible. Hopefully I can share them in a blog post at some point during this challenge.
