### Learning By Building

- I've been doing a lot of TDD over the past couple of weeks. I've also been working on a todo app to use in the terminal for the past couple of days - completely without TDD.

- I would have thought this was 'dirty' or 'unprofessional' a couple of months ago. What I've found is that it **doesn't really matter**. The question is really "am I happy doing this?", and it turns out I was because I do plan to build this with TDD in the future and get it on GitHub, but I'm learning a lot about what I want to be and what I want it to do by making small, incremental changes to a simple script. This process can only be a good thing!

Almost a Day 21!
