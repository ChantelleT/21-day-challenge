### Setting Goals

- Most of Day 12 was spent battling against intertia whilst continuing building a Rails app - it was one of those days.

- I've decided to step things up a notch in the 21 Day Challenge and use it as a method of accountability, so:

#### Goals for Day 13

- Get WIP blog post about my current understanding of and struggles with the Resository Pattern. Even though I don't have all the answers yet, documenting the process of discovery will make me work quicker and with more purpose.
- Practice Deliberate Discovery - 10 minute intervals of coding and a few minutes to reflect on my bottlenecks/general thoughts after each interval.
