### Looking Forward to Another 21 Days

- The first 21 Day Challenge was awesome! It really encouraged me to focus on longevity and grit (see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF3oViELrZw) from Sandi Metz on Grit) - in essence, it got me **doing** instead of **thinking**.
- My goals for this challenge:
  - Help out other challengers when I can (get involved on Gitter)
  - Build a lot more stuff with Ruby by playing games and automating tasks
  - Write more blog posts about things I have learned to do with Ruby and Rails
  - Stay calm and focus on the long-term (slowly pop bottlenecks off my bottlenecks list)
-
