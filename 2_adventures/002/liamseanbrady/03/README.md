### Multithreading and a Rails App

- The first half of Day 3 for me was spent learning about multithreading in Ruby. I watched [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o89mWFL-2A) by Jose Valim. I explored every possible alternative to multitheading for my CodeTime project, but it's finally become a bottleneck that I need to address in order to get the CLI working as I want. On the positive side, when the young whippersnappers are working with new shiny languages in 5 years' time I'll be able to tell tales of concurrent programming with MRI.

- The second half of Day 3 was spent rapidly prototyping a UI for a Rails app. This is my first time starting by building out the UI first, then doing the back end separately. It's a lot more enjoyable to do frontend when it's not mixed with the backend stuff!

Looking forward to Day 4!
