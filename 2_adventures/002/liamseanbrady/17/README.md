### Day 17

- Day 17 was awesome. Worked on my version of the Repository pattern in [CodeTime](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/code-time) and wrote a decent draft of a blog post on what I learned and my thought process throughout the whole thing.

- Looking forward to Day 18. Some Rails programming and 30 minutes of work on CodeTime is my aim.
