### Design Patterns

- I've been trying to reason about using the Repository Pattern in [CodeTime](). The thing that is great about design patterns is that it's a pattern, not an actual block of code (which is more of the perception I had in the past about design patters). I've been mostly avoiding tutorials in favour of asking myself how the design pattern (which I have a high level understanding of) should actually be implemented, and what I actually want to achieve by using it.

- I've started a blog post on the topic as I think having to go through a coherent process of writing about it will help me figure out exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing (and hopefully benefit others too).
