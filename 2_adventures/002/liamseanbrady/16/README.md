### What I Learned Today

- The 'how' is never as important as the 'why'. If you start coding without knowing the how, it just takes time to find out how to do something. If you start coding without knowing the why, then you'll keep digging a hole for yourself until you give up or ask yourself "why do I want to do this?" and start again.

- This has occurred for me twice with writing unit tests (with why stubbing and mocking is helpful), and design patterns (you still need to find **your implementation** of it, which is impossible without a reason as to why you think you need it).

- Constantly asking "why should I stub this method?", or "why should I make dependencies explicit?" has really helped me try to understand 'best practices' for myself instead of just following what a blog post tells me - very valuable lesson!
