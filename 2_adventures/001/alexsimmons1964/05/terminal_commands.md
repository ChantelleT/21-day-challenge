terminal commands I'm using
thought I'd list the terminal commands I've used:

cd
change directory/folder - and some variants of it's usage
cd ..
to go back up one level
cd ~
to go back to my C:\Users\Alex directory/folder on my Windows PC
cd directoryname1/directoryname2 
etc to navigate to a specific sub directory from where I am currently located

ls
list out whatever is in the directory
files, folders, anything.
using this to help me see what's in the next level down I need to navigate to.

mkdir directoryname
creating a new directory/folder
so far I am only game to first navigate with cd commands to the directory in which I'd like to add a new directory, then add a new folder with mkdir. 
OK so I'm a pussy, or an octocat, but baby steps right?
