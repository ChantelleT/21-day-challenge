# Day 20

Today I did the prep work for the `nth_prime` assignment on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) and implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm to determine prime numbers. The first version used an array that stored all natural numbers and sieved them, but for the second version I'd like to use a `Set` that acts as the sieve.
