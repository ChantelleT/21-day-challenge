# Day 21

Just want to share what I learnt this 21 days

- Started to use VIM as my editor of choice. It has a steep learning curve, but
  it's kinda fun. I think I'll continue using VIM in the future. It's important
  to do things in the VIM-way when working with this editor.

- I've also worked for first time with Minitest (and refreshed some rusty
  knowledge I had about RSpec). If I have to choose between this 2, I like
  RSpec the better.

- Life can be a huge problem when you want to do a challenge like this. Even if
  you will create only README files, sometimes it's really hard to do that 21
  days in a row due to your daily life. Some times it was nearly impossible to
  me to be able to commmit even a single README file due to things I had to
  attend, and also due to the timezone I live in and my daily job schedule
  (from 8:00 to 18:00)
 
- The most important thing I've learned it's that RubySteps is really fun, and
  I will probably enroll again in the future when I have more spare time :)
