# Day 21

For the last day, I'll try to wrap "taking a step" in an HTTP call. As long as I can call it three times in a row, I'm happy. I doubt I'll have the energy to add "do a walk of n steps", but I suppose I can't rule that out.

## Reviewing The Plan

Plan?!

## The Result

We can walk on the web, with this API:

* `/go` to start a new walk
* `/step` to take a step on the current walk
* `/logout` to clear the current session without starting a new walk
