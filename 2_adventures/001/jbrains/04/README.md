# Day 4

Today I wanted the ant to be able to take a second step. I don't mind using foreknowledge of the exact path to hardcode things. Once the ant takes 5-10 steps, I should have enough structure into which to shove the remaining behavior.

But wait! The ant doesn't flip the color of the square on his first step. I have to fix that.
