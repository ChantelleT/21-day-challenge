# Day 9

I want some graphics. I have no idea how to do graphics in Ruby. I haven't done graphics since high school. This will be interesting.

## An Incremental Approach

I have no idea whether this will work, but I need a plan. It will doubtless change. I think this might work:

1. Fixed viewport at the origin, simple grid of black and white squares, no representation of the ant.
1. Represent where the ant is.
1. Represent which way the ant is facing.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant exactly in the middle of the screen.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant approximately in the middle of the screen, in order to reduce viewport movement.
1. Profit?

It seems reasonable. It would thrill me to finish the first version in the next few days.

So... how do we do graphics in Ruby? DuckDuckGo to the rescue...
