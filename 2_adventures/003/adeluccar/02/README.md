### Rubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-06 003)

#### Day 02
Had an interesting chat with Victor Goff re: [Collectrium](http://www.collectrium.com/)'s UI.
We also spoke about deploying either on my own box at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or using [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).  

I think I will bite the bullet and go for my own deployment at DO. That should teach me how to deploy on my own and also on using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and VMs.

**Quick tip**  
- Use ```git commit -v``` to get a diff when writing a commit message.
