### Rubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-06 003)

#### Day 04
Just installed [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/).
This was done using this tutorial by [Tealeaf Academy](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-development-environment-for-mac-os-x).

The reasons are multiple. Mainly, I want to use a better terminal app ([iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/)) and I also want to avoid some issues I've had in the past using tmux.
