Rubysteps 21 Day Challenge (2015-06 003)

I will use this month's adventure to start a long running project. A rails app designed to show off an art collection and sell art pieces. I intend to learn the basic ropes (your typical mvc app) plus how to serve assets from amazon's s3's service. If time allows, I will also explore adding the polymer paper framework instead of your usual bootstrap or foundation one.
