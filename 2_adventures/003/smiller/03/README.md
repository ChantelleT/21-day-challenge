Day 1 was all very well, but overlooked that cucumber formatters after 1.3.19
donâ€™t output comments.  So on upgrading to 2.0.0, it does nothing at all.

But, supposing we pull up all the comments to the description block before
the first scenario, like so:

    JIRA:
	- OT-4655 (epic)
	- OT-6195 (validations)

	Hiptest:
	- https://hiptest.net/app#/projects/6907/testPlan/folders/15682/scenarios/84987 (OT-6195 #1)
	- https://hiptest.net/app#/projects/6907/testPlan/folders/15682/scenarios/84986 (OT-6195 #2)
	- https://hiptest.net/app#/projects/6907/testPlan/folders/15682/scenarios/93727 (OT-6195 #3)
	- https://hiptest.net/app#/projects/6907/testPlan/folders/15682/scenarios/93728 (OT-6195 #4a)
	- https://hiptest.net/app#/projects/6907/testPlan/folders/15682/scenarios/93729 (OT-6195 #4b)

	Todo:
	- OT-6195 #3a, #4b.i

And we know the prefix for JIRA URLs.  Can we turn all of these into links in
html-formatted output, at least?
