In Emacs, in TeX mode, it’s easy to get þ and ð characters, by typing \th and
\dh.  Outside of Emacs, I’m sure it’s doable, but I never remember how.

It would be nice to have a command-prompt that lets you type as normal and if
you type “h” sufficiently closely after “t” it turns into “þ”, like “h” after
“d” sufficiently closely “ð”.

Nice too if on exiting it copied to clipboard.

Hmm.  Time.now stuff feels icky.  Feels like should be able to do something with
benchmark instead.

The display of the string as it is being typed on subsequent lines is wonky:
should replace on same line.

A GUI might solve that too, and be more convenient to shortcut up.

Tests are conspicuous by their absence.
