# Day 8

## Continuing to ponder UI testing

Our QA people are finding capybara somewhat less intuitive (theyâ€™re moving from
writing features to writing step definitions now) and I remember we used watir
at the last place partly because QA found it more intuitive.  Either I need to
get better at explaining it, or we should investigate switching to watir
underneath while the body of step definitions is under control.

This would also affect which page object library we used, and we should be using
one regardless of whether the Day 7 sub-groups of page contents idea proves
feasible or not.

Continuing to ponder.
