Today I'm thinking about ruby versions for servers (as opposed to my previous thinking on locally managing ruby versions). I have begun getting an app ready to move to AWS (from Heroku) and will need to setup ruby on an Ubuntu instance.

Even though I do not use rbenv locally, It appears to be a good solution for a server. So I will try that.
