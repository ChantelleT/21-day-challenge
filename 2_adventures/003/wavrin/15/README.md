Today I thought a lot about managing ruby versions. I'd recently upgraded computers and wanted to change how I managed ruby versions.

On previous computer I used rvm + gemsets. But that seemed to get a bit hairy.

On new computer, I'm using just new version of ruby and letting Bundler handle gem versions.

So far, so good. It was not as hard as I thought updating apps to new version of Ruby.

And not having to use gemsets hace been nice. :)
