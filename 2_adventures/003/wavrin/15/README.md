Today I though a lot of ruby version management. I switched to a new laptop over the last few weeks and decided to do things a little different.

On previous computer, I used rvm and gemsets to manager different apps. It ended up getting a bit hairy.

I decided to take this opportunity to update the ruby version of alls I've been working on. And then use bundler to manage all the gem versions.

So far, so good.
